**BotARom1** is a python bot for twitter that I made in order to **improve my python skills**. His functions are a **pretty basic** and **not very useful**, but again, **it wasn't made for that**.
***

## How can I install it?
You should be set with the simple following command.
You might want to create a virtual environment before though.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
***

## But what can it do?
### Ping
When you mention BotARom1 saying **ping**, it will answer **pong**. Useful to know if he's online!
### Asterix
When you answer a tweet by mentioning BotARom1 and saying **asterix**, it will answer with an image. The image is from Asterix, and text will be replaced with the tweet.
